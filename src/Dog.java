public class Dog extends Animal {
    //🏭🏭[INHERITANCE]🏭🏭 // first we must create an empty "public" class in the "Animal.java" class

    public Dog() {
        super("Mathew", "Big", 50);//inside "super" we must add the attributes need it in the "Animal.java" file
    }
}// the "Dog" file will inherit all the attributes from the "Animal.java" file, and we can add more attributes (type, size and weight)
